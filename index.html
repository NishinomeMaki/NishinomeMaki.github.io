<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
   industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text <br>
   ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of  <br>
   type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived <br>
   not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br>
   remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with <br>
   the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and  <br>
   more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <br>
   including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
